AlphaSpotify (console)
A minimal, performance-focused console music player that uses yt-dlp to resolve stream URLs and mpv for audio-only playback. No heavy GUI, just a simple console menu.

No installation required.

Notes
- The spec includes mpv-bin, ffmpeg-bin, yt_dlp, and icon.
- If issues, add hidden imports as needed.
- Keep packages consistent (x86_64) with your system.

Controls
- Search by query, pick a result, play via mpv.
- Playback is audio-only, streaming directly from the resolved URL.
